SHIFT is a small FPS project that im working. The main gimick of this game is that the player has the ability to 'shift' between this world and another reality. This allows for some super cool puzzle/problem-solving.

It's not supposed to be a super polished thing, but i've done my very best to attempt to create a cool setting and environment to complement the 'shift' mechanics.

## Setting
The game is set in a secret underground facility recently damaged by some conflict happening up above. The player must try and retrieve a piece of special quantum technology which has been badly damaged and has openned up fractures in the space-time continuum.  

## Shift Ability
The player, using their S.H.I.F.T device (Spectrum Hyperspace Interchange Field Transfer) can temporarily jump or shift to an alternate reality, allowing them to avoid or circumnavigate a problem in our world.

## 'Echos'
The shift ability, though extremely useful, has an unfortunate side-effect. It leaves behinds 'echos' of the player's former self. These enemies are tough, infused with the raw entropy of time and space, they have absolutly nothing to loose by killing you so you'll want to avoid them wherever you can.

## Weapons
The player is equiped with a Pistol at first, allowing them to defend themselfs at a basic level, but soon upgrades to a shotgun which is equipped with a number of special upgrades to help them get through the facility more safely. And much later in the game, they aquire a 'Beam Oscillator' that is specifically designed to deal with these 'echos' by shifting them to the other reality.
