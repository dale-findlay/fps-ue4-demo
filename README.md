# FPS demo 
Even though its an FPS i dont think i'll have shooting, i dont have the art resources to make the shooting reasonably good so i'm inclined to just not include it for this demo. The game will be implemented in C++. 

# Setting
The game will set in a warehouse with some basic sneak and navigation through the shelving to avoid the enemies.

# Enemies in this game:
Sticking with the horror theme, i think the enemies in this game should be extremly deadly. Maybe not zombies per-se but something like the clickers from the last of us, 
i wont be able to capture the nueance of Naughty Dog's amazing enemies but i'll do my best to make it work from this demo.

# Shift mechanic
A few years ago i was messing around with a mechnic called "SHIFT" that was bascially like moving temporarily to a parallel universe, 
in the parallel universe the enemies might be in different places allowing you to navigate through without getting caught.

# The actual goal?
perhaps the goal in this game is just to make it through the facility without dying
